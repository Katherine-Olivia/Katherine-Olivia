## 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a pre-final year AI & Data Science student from **Shiv Nadar University Chennai** with a passion for building scalable cloud systems, analyzing network traffic, and developing robust machine learning models. I enjoy deep-diving into AWS internals and optimizing large datasets with efficient algorithms.

I’m currently exploring advanced AWS networking, distributed systems, and fraud detection at scale.
